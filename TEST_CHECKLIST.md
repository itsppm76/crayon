# Crayon test checklist

Covers the deployed bot (`cr_*.py`, Neon Postgres, Gemini, Tavily). Run these against a staging bot or your own chat.

Legend: **Verified live** = checked on the deployed bot through `/selftest` with synthetic users that were cleaned up afterwards (October 8, 2026). **Not live-tested** = reviewed in code only.

## Automated checks

- [ ] `GET /health` returns `{"ok": true, ...}` with `db: true`
- [ ] `POST /selftest` without a token returns `403`
- [ ] `POST /selftest` with `Authorization: Bearer <CRAYON_ADMIN_TOKEN>` runs a message through the real pipeline and returns results

```bash
curl https://crayon-v1.onrender.com/health
curl -X POST https://crayon-v1.onrender.com/selftest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRAYON_ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"texts": ["hello"], "cleanup": true}'
```

`/selftest` uses a synthetic negative user id and captures replies, so nothing is sent to Telegram. Optional body fields: `reset`, `tick` (run one scheduler tick), `probe` (`reminders` or `facts`), `cleanup`.

## Feature checks

| Area | Check | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Memory | Tell Crayon a fact, start a new chat, ask for it back. `/memory` lists it. | Verified live |
| Memory | `/forget <key>` removes it and confirms | Verified live |
| Search | Ask for something current; the reply cites a source URL | Verified live (Tavily, with fallbacks) |
| Code | Ask for exact math; the answer comes from the sandbox | Verified live |
| Reminders | "Remind me in 2 minutes to ..." is delivered by the scheduler | Verified live |
| Scheduled jobs | "In 1 minute, search the web for ..." runs the search itself and sends the result | Verified live |
| Tracked tasks | A multi-step plan becomes a task with steps; marking a step done persists; "where are we on X?" recalls progress | Verified live |
| Task check-in | One nudge per quiet task per day, between 9am and 9pm local time | Not live-tested (needs a task untouched for 20h or more) |
| Confirmation | Forget a fact, reply NO: nothing changes. Forget again, reply YES: it is removed. | Verified live |
| Confirmation | A pending confirmation expires after 10 minutes | Not live-tested |
| Secrets | Paste something that looks like an API key or password; the message is deleted and not saved (a database search found zero stored rows) | Verified live |
| Honesty guard | The bot never says "saved" or "set" without a verified tool result in that turn | Not separately live-tested |
| Daily cap | After `CRAYON_DAILY_CAP` messages in a day the bot says the free-tier limit was reached | Not live-tested |
| Delete all | `/delete_my_data` asks for `confirm`; with it, everything is wiped and the bot reports the check | Not live-tested |

## Manual acceptance flow

1. Open [`@crayon_v1_bot`](https://t.me/crayon_v1_bot) and send `/start`, `/help`, `/memory`.
2. Tell it a preference, then ask about it in a fresh message.
3. Ask a question that needs the web and check that a source is given.
4. Set a reminder a couple of minutes out and wait for it.
5. Give it a multi-step plan, mark one step done, then ask where you stand.
6. Ask it to forget something; answer NO, then try again and answer YES.
7. Use two Telegram accounts and confirm memory never crosses users.

## Prototype tests

`pytest -q` runs the offline tests in `tests/`. They cover the original prototype code in `core/` and `tools/` with mocked model responses. They say nothing about the deployed `cr_*.py` bot.

## Phase 2

M7: `/goal <concrete research/calculation goal>` saves a 2-4 step plan and executes with up to 12 tools, repeat-call limits, and a time budget. Local runtime tests pass. Verified live: /goal calculated 17 x 23 with sandbox output, saved a note, updated both steps, and cleaned up the synthetic user. Admin form `/admin-test` uses captured output and requires the existing admin token. Selftest rejects real user IDs; scheduler excludes negative test users.

M8: photo/PDF/text/audio ingestion, 4 MB limit, untrusted-content analysis, no raw upload retention. Live image fixture verified; Telegram downloads and PDF/audio remain untested.
M9: /memory_review returns exact duplicate groups and evidence-backed preference suggestions, changes no facts. Verified live duplicate detection with two stored facts; no deletion.

M10 draft_message: review only, no external sender. M11 /proactive on|off: at most one stale-task or upcoming-reminder check-in daily. M12 /digest morning|evening|both|off and /digest_now: deterministic summaries. Defaults off, quiet hours 21-09 local; free-host delivery best-effort. Verified live with a synthetic clock: morning digest and upcoming-reminder check-in delivered once, repeat tick produced no messages. Draft fixture verified sent=false after fixing an invented excuse.

M14: content-based emoji selection and captured reaction calls. Command/YES/NO flows skipped. Telegram acceptance in a real chat not yet tested.
M8 update: synthetic PDF sentence read exactly. Real Telegram download path and actual spoken voice note not yet tested.
Runtime tests cover goal execution, invalid-tool handling, media size/type limits, duplicate detection, draft non-send, quiet hours, daily limits and reaction selection.

## Media/style expansion

- Local tests: 20 MB rejection boundary, unknown format receipt, safe ZIP listing, DOCX XML extraction, entity rejection, secret blocking, text truncation disclosure, video/caption routing, and final plain-text cleanup.
- Live verified in owner Telegram chat: new Yooooo fire reaction; photo red square + CRAYON TEST 42; immediate receipt and both timed progress lines; clean plain text; DOCX OCEAN 73; 5,880,039-byte text file LARGE 81 with truncation notice; later photo follow-up answered CRAYON TEST 42.
- Still pending live: video/large-binary Files API upload and confirmed deletion, exact 20 MB boundary, more formats. A real 15-second user MP4 (3,666,841 bytes) was read successfully through Files API; its event-ad text and summary were delivered at 22:47 IST. Independent provider deletion check remains pending.

M13 Google beta, October 8:
- 37 local tests pass, including user-bound encryption, replay, wrong-user draft access, tamper, timeout-no-retry and private-chat gate.
- Cloud client created; API enablement, scopes, Render secrets and live OAuth/read/disconnect verification still pending.
- Real email send is NOT tested; requires owner review of final recipient/content before any live send.
- Public verification and security assessment are NOT complete. No paid assessment authorized.

M15 prepared, not deployed: 41 local tests including exact group mention, ignored untagged groups, no private state and disabled group tools. Slow-text progress timer and revised prompt need owner-chat checks. Group tagging needs a real group test. Keep BotFather privacy mode ON; exact @crayon_v1_bot mentions are sufficient. No existing group was selected or messaged.
M13 2.16.0 live: health ok/db true. Privacy page visually inspected. Cloud credentials in Render; Gmail API enabled. Live captured smoke test passes /help and synthetic private-Google rejection. OAuth and real reads/send still untested; public verification not submitted.

October 8 23:15 IST live follow-up:
- 2.17.1 health ok=true/db=true.
- Personal OAuth completed; real /google_status, /gmail search (five IDs/headers), /gmail_read newsletter body and /calendar next-seven-days passed in owner's DM.
- Real one-line /email_draft self-addressed review-only fixture displayed exact content/hash; /email_cancel answered no send. Real send not tested; owner has a separate draft that was not touched by these tests.
- Slow text response delivered progress before clean final answer; revised prompt inspected on one HTTP/HTTPS sample, not a quality benchmark.
- BotFather says privacy ENABLED, with username mentions delivered. Left unchanged. Real group delivery not yet tested; no group chosen or messaged.
- Public Google verification not submitted; testing status remains. No payment/assessment initiated.

2.17.2: live health good, exact-content draft buttons visually inspected, Cancel callback passed in owner DM without send. Search Console URL-prefix ownership verification succeeded by homepage HTML tag. This is not OAuth app approval. Verification submission remains pending its end-to-end sanitized demo. No production publish, paid assessment or real test send initiated. His separately entered draft was left untouched.

## 2.18.0 conversational UX (October 8)
- 50 unique local tests pass, including absent/guessed recipient, forwarded input, no model inbox path, review-bound simple send and hidden draft IDs.
- BotFather privacy DISABLED confirmed. Real owner test group tagged greeting and tagged question answered. Untagged reply ignored. Membership welcome not live exercised.
- Friendly guide/reply keyboard, direct Google intent reads, encrypted pending recipient clarification, reviewed Send/Cancel and simple text confirmation. Single recipient, no CC/BCC/attachments. Previous draft invalidated on new review. Google results remain outside model and memory.
- Natural mail/calendar/draft, delete UI and reply keyboard require live readback; do not call all phrases proven. Existing commands remain power options.
- Real 2.18 chat proofs: natural `help` guide, `Email [owner address] saying ...` exact review with hidden IDs, Cancel button returned no-send, natural calendar returned events, natural mail search returned Google's no-matches result, privacy options displayed review/delete buttons.
- No new live send for `send it`; local review-pointer/UID/expiry gates tested. No destructive delete or disconnect performed. Welcome needs a future add event. Reply-keyboard layout still needs pixel inspection with keyboard opened.
- Privacy second-confirmation + Keep my data passed live, with unchanged-data acknowledgement. No destructive test.
- Reply keyboard opened and visually inspected: all 6 choices legible in 2 columns. Natural calendar recheck uses readable day/date/time in 2.18.1.

## Phase3 (October8-9, latest state supersedes earlier pending entries)
- Public pasted example.com read verified in real Telegram. First deep-research comparison returned links and403 disclosure but uneven subjects; improved per-subject bounded search and citation instruction, second live proof pending.
- Frankfurter10USD ->966.30INR dated2026-10-08/source verified. Fixed singular unit aliases and real1mile ->1.609744km passed.
-2.20.1 natural 'Please connect my Google account' returned a real tappable connection link without reply-keyboard dependence.
- Four Google tester addresses persist in Audience; External/Testing unchanged. No production publishing.
- Current78 local tests include bounded CSV, formula escaping, chart validity, mocked sendDocument confirmation, text aliases, short-connect state-only fixed destination, used/expired rejection.
-2.21.0 CSV/chart and short link are built/deployed; real transport/redirect proof is in progress. No claim of all live checks yet.
-6workers is a code ceiling, not measured comfortable user capacity. Project-wide Gemini free quotas verified15/250k/500(primary),15/250k/500(fallback1),5/250k/20(fallback2). API requests are not chat replies.

2.21.1 incident follow-up: owner forwarded own Google link; live DB/status confirmed Sibi Google under owner1898030979. Owner approved disconnect; bot confirmed Google revocation, credentials/drafts removal, independent DB empty +status none. Later7555366869 independently connected Sibi Google; untouched. No mailbox/calendar content retrieved for diagnosis. Historical 'Plz connect to my Google' missed deterministic alias and got a false general-model denial; added plz/pls/to variants and tests.81 tests pass. Short link live issuance and Google fixed-client redirect passed; invalid state400 passed. No new OAuth consent performed by agent. Files/research post-fix live proof remains pending due to incident priority.

## Phase3 computer/browser and closure (Oct9,00:47IST)
-2.23.1 live health;97 local tests pass, including progress race, owner-only computer/path/arithmetic checks and browser denylist cases.
- M19: CSV50B/chart15.3KB received in owner Telegram. Delivered chart inspected at full size: Maths3/Finance5/Strategy2, clean labels, units and supplied-data disclaimer.
- M17: initial retest still searched unrelated Obsidian Energy/Notion-vs-Monday. Fixed compared-name extraction preserving purpose context and official-source preference. Subsequent real retest uses Notion education/help and Obsidian/help. Model claim/citation synthesis remains fallible.
- M20: GitHub Pro student, fresh Codespaces budget$0/Stop usageYes, consumed/billable$0 checked before creation. Created2-core Southeast Asia Linux Codespace, no public ports. Outbound worker dedicated bridge token, owner-only fixed operations,25-minute session cap, no auto-restart.
- Real computer status +20*(3+2)/4 returned25. Real Chromium Python tutorial task delivered159KB crayon-browser.png and URL log to owner Telegram at00:47. Full delivered-image pixels inspected: readable Python tutorial and sidebar.
- Browser initial bridge failures produced fake model '(screenshot attached)' text with no attachment. Deterministic screenshot routing now requires verified result AND PNG bytes; fail-closed errors instead.
- Remaining: real group welcome-on-add, real computer file create/read (initial operation error fail-closed; schema enum fixed, retest pending), README rendered final phase table inspection. Public Google verification still pending, no paid assessment initiated.

Tester release2.24.0: owner+Sibi UID gate;5 execution jobs per tester/day,20 owner/day,30 total/day, atomically reserved before jobs including failures. No automatic wake. Uttiya not enabled until verified Telegram ID.97 local tests, tester behavior code-tested, not impersonated/live-tested as Sibi.
