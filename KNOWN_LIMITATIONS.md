# Known limitations

## Current release - October 9, 2026

[Final live checklist](LIVE_FEATURE_CHECKLIST.md) supersedes historical checkpoints below. Per-user access update,360 local tests; previous runtime `e4331d3`. Computer/browser/private file operations are open to every Telegram account with quotas. Calendar and mail-watch use each user's own Google connection, subject to external Google Testing. Historical owner/tester limits below are superseded. Telegram, independent Google and verified email/password login are deployed/configured; real standalone acceptance is pending. Accounts keep separate history/memory unless an unused identity is explicitly linked. Consolidation is OFF by owner choice and no production merge happened.

Browser-only reminders/scheduled jobs/background delivery are unavailable. Web rooms, computer execution, deletion confirmations, work-queue controls and full command parity remain unfinished. Actual calendar Create and connected Workspace/GitHub acceptance are unproven. WhatsApp is parked. No paid setup occurred. Historical single-recipient notes below predate reviewed To/CC/BCC support; attachments remain unavailable. Historical form-demo and mail-watch pending notes predate their real Telegram checks on October9.

Status is intentionally conservative. This file reflects the deployed bot (`cr_*.py` modules, Neon Postgres, Render free tier).

- **Free hosting:** Render's free instance sleeps when idle and can be slow on a cold start. A keep-warm ping reduces this but does not guarantee uptime.
- **Reminder timing:** reminders and jobs are delivered by an in-process polling scheduler. Delivery is close to the due time, not exact, and is delayed if the host is down.
- **Free-tier quotas:** Gemini, Tavily and Neon have free-tier limits. A per-user daily message cap (default 80) is in place to stay inside them.
- **Search quality:** results depend on Tavily and its fallbacks. Snippets can be stale or wrong, and page text is treated as untrusted data.
- **Code sandbox:** no network, files or access to user data, by design. It is for exact math and checks, not data fetching.
- **Heuristic safety:** secret detection and the honesty guard are pattern-based checks, not guarantees. If a real secret is pasted into a chat, rotate it.
- **Model mistakes:** the model can misread dates, time zones or intent. Confirm reminders and task details when they matter.
- **External writes:** reviewed Gmail drafts can be sent only after exact recipient/content confirmation. No automatic sends, calendar creation, third-party outreach or purchases.
- **Google integrations:** live per-user OAuth is in `cr_google.py`; the older `core/` helper is unused.
- **Prototype leftovers:** `core/`, `adapters/`, `tools/`, `db/schema.sql` and the Colab notebook are from the first prototype. The offline tests in `tests/` cover that code and mock model calls.

Phase 2 limits: goals are bounded tool workflows, not unrestricted autonomous browser agents. Media downloads cap at 20,000,000 bytes. Common photos, PDF, audio and video use Gemini; large media/video uses temporary Files API uploads with best-effort immediate deletion and a warning if deletion fails (provider auto-expiry: 48 hours). Office files are text/cell extraction only, bounded to 24,000 characters; layout/images/formulas are not verified. ZIP/TAR archives get listings only, never execution/extraction. Unknown formats are acknowledged but not decoded. A short media analysis summary is retained in chat history for follow-ups; raw files are not saved locally. Memory review does not auto-merge facts. Drafts do not send. Proactive check-ins and digests are opt-in and depend on the host running. Per-user Google beta is active for named testers.

Google beta accepts natural-language private-chat requests plus optional slash commands. Only user intent is parsed by the model; Google results bypass it. Calendar reads primary only, next seven days. Gmail reads five search results and bounded plaintext bodies. Email drafts allow one recipient, no CC/BCC/attachments; ten-minute confirmation, no uncertain-send retries. Testing mode limits access to named users and refresh tokens can expire after seven days. Public verification is pending; a paid restricted-scope assessment must be reported, never initiated.

Phase3 (2.20.1): public HTTP link reading, no JavaScript/login/paywall bypass, 1MB/12k-character caps, redirect private-host checks. Research retrieves bounded sources and labels failures; source coverage and model citation quality remain fallible. Currency is dated reference data, not a live quote; fees excluded. Unit conversion is fixed Decimal arithmetic with bounded supported units. Weather remains search-based; no Open-Meteo tool.

Capacity is not load-tested. Six update workers, per-user serialization; sustained requests hit model quotas first. Current Crayon free project: primary3.5 Flash Lite15RPM/250k inputTPM/500RPD, fallback3.1 Flash Lite15/250k/500, fallback3 Flash5/250k/20. Limits are project-wide, can change, and model/verification/memory/tool workflows consume several calls per reply. Multiple keys in one project do not increase quota. Render Free0.1CPU/512MB; no uptime guarantee.

2.21 files: CSV/bar-chart generation is bounded to user-requested exports and supplied/verified data, no generated server code. CSV formulas are escaped, charts support non-negative values only. Pillow renders at1000px;12bars max. PNG screenshots/charts use sendPhoto within dimensions, other files use sendDocument;2MB max/two per response. No hosted public artifacts. Short Google connection URL validates existing unused10-minute state and uses fixed Google endpoint/config. Never forward account-bound links; friends must request their own.

Computer/browser beta: owner+approved-tester Codespaces2-core machine, owner files private, outbound worker bridge, fresh public-web Chromium with public-IP checks and known sensitive-portal hostname/path deny rules, not a perfect category classifier. Automatic machine wake is enabled after the October 9 lifecycle test; no shell/eval/imports through the bot, no other user's access to the owner's GitHub-bearing machine. Worker session defaults25minutes; deployment-controlled approved sessions max6hours. Text files restricted to one dedicated directory with no overwrite/delete/symlink access. Browser two-page cap, GET-only requests, no credentials/forms/accounts/transactions/downloads. Screenshot is a viewport capture, not a guarantee of correct page content. Codespaces incurs storage usage even while stopped;180core-hours equals about90hours at2cores. Stop when finished and keep the$0 paid budget blocked.

Tester beta: owner+approved-tester UID gate;5 execution jobs per tester/day,20 owner/day,30 total/day, atomically reserved before jobs including failures. Automatic wake is enabled after real October 9 cold-start/worker/calculation/idle-stop proof. Additional testers are not enabled until their Telegram IDs are verified.203 local tests, tester behavior code-tested, no impersonation or live test from another person's chat.

World Bank chart chain is one fixed recipe (India/China/USA,2024 nominal GDP per capita), not arbitrary autonomous research. Exact records validated before outputs. Instagram login wall and YouTube signed-out homepage screenshot passed; authenticated browsing, search and playback are not claimed.

2.32.1 internal work: explicit1-3-step jobs only, public-source receipts/briefs/basic arithmetic. Real Telegram queue arithmetic, completion, Show results and TXT export passed October 9. Briefs are fallible AI drafts with fetched-URL checking, not complete assignments.3 jobs/user/day,10global/day, no Google/external effects, quiet-hour delivery, interrupted jobs block without retry. Scheduled model jobs read-only enforced. Automatic cold-start, worker readiness, calculation and idle-stop passed October 9; a later stop/readiness race was corrected, with fresh form acceptance pending.

Scheduled model jobs cannot run pending confirmations or mutating tools. Background-work arithmetic uses Decimal at28digits, so repeating decimals are rounded and labelled. The queue runs in its own thread; host uptime is still not guaranteed.

2.33 completion notifications claim delivery once before sending; transport failure is labelled uncertain without resend to avoid duplicates. Buttons bind to owner/private chat and valid current state; real Telegram Show results/TXT export button proof passed October 9. Task status can be done/doing/blocked/todo, finished tasks reopen on non-done step.

## October 9 current-state checkpoint (supersedes older historical milestones)

203 local tests pass. Real Telegram queue arithmetic, Show results/TXT export, dashboard recorded completion/CSV/chart, silent-audio no-speech, blue-video and PDF regression passed. Gemini stays primary; free-only OpenRouter forced-failure proof passed, automatic fallback enabled and deployed 14:41 IST. Owner hourly mail watch delivered a real two-item Telegram notification at 15:00 IST; checked advanced from 13:59:59 to 15:00:11, seen_count 0 to 2, not paused.

Calendar reads, preview/create/cancel/reconnect are owner-only. Optional guests and popup reminders have exact preview and payload/readback regressions. Live preview/Cancel passed with no event; Google write-scope reconnect and actual reviewed Create remain unproven. Guest notifications only after Create; no Meet.

Public form foundation implemented for a controlled demo. Local fresh Chromium verifies inspect without POST, changed-page rejection without POST, exact reviewed submission with one POST and receipt. Live worker demo and dynamic Google appointment/Calendly slot adapter remain open. Never claim provider booking from generic fixture evidence.

Groups support bounded public lookup for anyone who tags the bot. News is dated Google News index headlines plus publishers, not independently verified article summaries. In2.35 a separate group action route supports each requester's own records/actions after per-member audience opt-in. Public lookup still excludes private context. Connection links/background monitoring stay private. Other members cannot confirm the requester's controls. Real owner group news acceptance passed October 9 at 14:32, then owner requested text-only UX without links.

No paid activity initiated. Google public verification/possible restricted-scope assessment and outside-tester acceptance remain external gates. WhatsApp on this Telegram instance was stopped; optional shared code is maintained in the same repository.

Latest 15:02 checkpoint: worker Playwright/Chromium and Debian browser libraries installed; direct controlled form inspection verified with zero POST. The real Telegram preview at 14:57 failed because a 14:56 idle-stop left a fresh cached heartbeat. Lifecycle fix clears readiness on accepted start/stop and serializes readiness/activity/enqueue against idle-stop. Full suite: 203 passed. Live preview/Submit remain unproven. Awake-but-exited worker needs a host restart or explicit supervisor start; API start on an already-awake host does not rerun postStart. Public-news topic/date/relevance/publisher cleanup is deployed, but post-fix group acceptance is still pending.

2.35:223automated tests. Complete generated emails use supplied context and user intent, with no invented facts and exact-body mode when requested. Real group action acceptance pending; WhatsApp two-way remains pending Meta provisioning cooldown.
